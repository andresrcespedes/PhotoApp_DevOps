Write a short text document explaining the (REST or gRPC) API of your service.
    We are going to implement a filter photo service where the user is going to apply predetermined filters to the already uploaded photos 
    on the photo service. The filtered photos will be uploaded to the photo service.

User Interface.
    In the user interface the users will be able to see the uploaded photos (without filters). After clicking the original photo, they would
    be able to see the filtered version of the aforementioned image alongside the original image.

        JSON response body.

        POST to upload the contour of an image on the photo service. The image will be identified by its URI location given in the payload.
